# Creating a Django Project

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Install Virtualenv:
   
    pip install virtualenv
    

2. Create Virtual Environment:
   
    virtualenv environment_name
   

3. Activate Virtual Environment:
   
    .\env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   

4. Install Django:
    
    pip install django
  

5. Create Project:
    
    django-admin startproject myproject
   

6. Navigate to Project Directory:
   
    cd myproject
   

7. Start Development Server:
    
    python manage.py runserver
  

8. Create App:
  
    python manage.py startapp myapp


9. Add App to Settings:
  
    # In myproject/settings.py
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'myapp',
        
    ]


10. Define a Model:
    python
    # In myapp/models.py
    from django.db import models

    class Post(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        content = models.TextField()
        created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.title


11.Apply Migrations:
  
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
 

12. Create View and URL:
  
    # In myapp/views.py
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    def index(request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
    

  
    # In myapp/urls.py
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.index, name='index'),
    ]
    


    # In myproject/urls.py
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import include, path

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
    ]
   

13. Run Development Server:
    
    python manage.py runserver
   

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/` in your browser to see "Hello, world!".

#How to check installed version of Django?
